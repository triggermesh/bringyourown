# Bring Your Own

TriggerMesh [Cloud](https://cloud.triggermesh.io) provides built-in event sources and targets. However there many cases that we most likely have not thought of yet and you may want to bring your own event source or your own target and you may need to transform events in a custom way.

This repository shows you how to bring your own sources, targets and transformations (e.g BYOS, BYOT) in several languages.

TLDR: You need to emit, consume and transform [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/)
